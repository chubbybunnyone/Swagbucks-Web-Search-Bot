One thing to note in the program is that it may be a bit buggy and sometimes may not work properly. For example, when your asked to choose what browser you want to begin the searches, it may just choose your default browser. The programmer at the moment will go ahead and fix that under another update. For now, the best solution is to change your default browser to the one on the list you'd like to select.

At the moment, the only version we support right now is Windows. macOS and Linux are right now under development and will indeed be fixed.
