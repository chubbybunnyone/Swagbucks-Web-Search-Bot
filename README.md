One thing to note in the program is that it may be a bit buggy and sometimes may not work properly. For example, when your asked to choose what browser you want to begin the searches, it may just choose your default browser. The programmer at the moment will go ahead and fix that under another update. For now, the best solution is to change your default browser to the one on the list you'd like to select.

At the moment, the only platforms we support are now Windows and macOS. Linux distributions are being developed and are underway
